  * New upstream version includes :
    o Exclude page structures of non-dumped pages
     - Add the new option "-e" to exclude the page structures which correspond
       to excluded pages. This option will bring a great performance, but it
       will harm analyticity a little bit. Please see the note below:

       NOTE: If you specify this option, crash will show the message below
             and the 'kmem' command will not work.

           This dumpfile is incomplete because the page structures associated
           with excluded pages may also be excluded.  This may cause the crash
           session to fail entirely, may cause commands to fail (most notably
           the "kmem" command), or may result in unpredictable runtime behavior.

       Now this option supports only x86_64.

    o Support new kernels
     - The supported kernel is updated to 4.5 in this version.

  * [ Juerg Haefliger <juerg.haefliger@hp.com> ]

    Limit the number of dumps kept on the local machine

    Introduce a new config variable KDUMP_NUM_DUMPS that specifies how
    many dumps should be kept on the machine. This can be use to prevent
    running out of disk space. It is ignored if remote dumping (ssh or nfs)
    is enabled. If there are too many dump files, older dumps are purged but
    only after the current dump operation succeeded.

  * [ Linn Crosetto <linn@hp.com> ]

    kdump-config: add support for UEFI Secure Boot

    kdump-config needs to query the state of UEFI Secure Boot in order to correctly
    use kexec to boot the crash kernel. Specifically, kexec needs the "-s" option
    to use the kexec_file_load system call to validate the image before loading it.
    (Closes: #823003)

  * [Hari Bathini <hbathini@linux.vnet.ibm.com>]

    Fix networked kdump failure to reach remote server. Avoids
    "Network is unreachable" message when trying to do remote dumps on either
    SSH or NFS. (LP: #1571590)

  * Add support for architecture-specific crashkernel param

    On Debian, the crashkernel boot parameter is left undefined. On Ubuntu
    it was defined in the kexec-tools package, modified specifically.

    This parameter is now defined by the kdump-tools package and uses an
    architecture-specific file containing the definition. A generic symlink
    called /etc/default/grub.d/kdump-tools.cfg points to the architecture
    specific file.
    
    The default values are :

     - All but ppc64el : 128M
     - ppc64el : 2G-4G:320M,4G-32G:512M,32G-64G:1024M,64G-128G:2048M,128G-:4096M@32M

    (LP: #1567539)
    On s390x architecture, the crashkernel parameter is added to the
    /etc/zipl.conf file.

    /etc/default/kdump-tools is also modified to use the cio_ignore parameter
    when kexec loads the crash kernel (LP: #1570775)

  * Allow for symlinks to be created for vmlinux files : On Power8
    architecture, systems are booting from a vmlinux file. The symlink
    /var/lib/kdump/vmlinuz has to point to this file.  (LP: #1536904)

  * Add functionality to create symlinks for older kernels : If kdump
    is installed on systems with more than one kernel package, the smaller
    initrd.img file will only be created for the latest kernel. Adding the
    'symlinks' functionality will allow for the creation of symlinks to
    older kernels. If the smaller initrd.img file is missing in /var/lib/kdump
    it will be created beforehand.  This will be preempted if kdump is already
    loaded. (LP: #1537714)

  * Fix kdump-config manpage : add documentation for the propagate option.
    (LP: #1538148)

  * New upstream version includes :
    o Parallel compression
     - Add the new option "--num-threads" to enable parallel compression
       for faster processing. This option intends parallel compression
       while --split intends parallel i/o, they try to solve different
       bottlenecks.

    o Change the way to choose the non-cyclic mode
     - Add the new option "--work-dir" to specify the directory used to
       store the bitmap. This is the alternative to the combination of
       --non-cyclic and TMPDIR.

    o Support new kernels
     - The supported kernel is updated to 4.2 in this version.

  * Debian specific enhancements :

    - kdump-tools now make use of smaller initrd.img files created in
    /var/lib/kdump. This avoid optential OOM when the size of the initrd.img
    becomes larger (LP: #1496317).  Implementation details are :

      o New kernel hooks are added to create smaller initrd.img files when new
        kernel packages are installed :
          /etc/kernel/postrm.d/kdump-tools
          /etc/kernel/postinst.d/kdump-tools

      o kdump-config is responsible for the maintenance of symbolic links used
        to point to the appropriate vmlinuz & initrd files. Link maintenance
        is done at each boot by kdump-config. New links will point to the
        files named after the running kernel.

      o The KDUMP_KERNEL and KDUMP_INITRD configuration variables are now
        now enabled and use the symbolic links :
          /var/lib/kdump/vmlinuz
          /var/lib/kdump/initrd.img

      o kdump-config has been adapted to show the symbolic link information

    - kdump-tools is now enabled by default.  When installed a prompt will
      propose to override the default value.

makedumpfile (1:1.5.8-1) sid; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version includes :
    o Fair I/O workload assignment for --split
    - Add the new option "--splitblock-size" to specify the permissible
      difference of each splitted dumpfile size. Please note that the
      difference can be larger than the specified size since this feature
      doesn't care about zero page filtering.

    o Make incomplete dumpfile readable
    - DUMP_DH_COMPRESSED_INCOMPLETE or DUMP_ELF_INCOMPLETE flag will be set
      in the header of dumpfiles if ENOSPC occurs. The flags make crash utility
      attempt analyzing the dumpfile even it is known to be incomplete.

    o Support new kernels
    - The supported kernel is updated to 3.19 in this version.

makedumpfile (1.5.7-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version includes :
    - Show the memory usage of 1st kernel : Add the new option 
      "--mem-usage" to show the memory usage at a given moment 
      in 1st kernel. This will be helpful to estimate the 
      appropriate storage size to store a filtered dumpfile,
      thanks Baoquan.

    -  hugepage filtering : Both THPs and hugetlbfs pages are now 
       excluded as user pages.  As for hugetlbfs, this feature 
       will be enabled for linux-3.16 or later.
